# Week 2 Homework: Portfolio

 - Homework solution (hosted using Github):

## The Task
We are to create a personal Portfolio page from scratch, which we can add to as the course goes on.
We are to make use of our new skills in things like flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
Having said that, if we do not yet have enough work to fill in the required slots, we can use placeholder images and text and update it later.

## Acceptance Criteria
This is the list of Acceptance Criteria that we need to follow:
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
